/**
 * Created by pascalwelsch on 11/20/14.
 * <p>
 * Default implementation of the {@link TrayPreferences} which uses
 * the app package name as module name.
 * <p>
 * Use this {@link PreferenceAccessor} to save your preferences of
 * your app independent of a single app module. It's not a good practice to put all preferences in
 * a
 * single module. Extend the {@link TrayPreferences} and gain the functionality to remove all
 * data of a single module. This could help keeping the saved data as small as possible across app
 * upgrades.
